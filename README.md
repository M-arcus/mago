### Inspiration

Mago is inspired by several tools and projects that have significantly contributed to the development community:

- [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy): A collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code.
- [OXC](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/): A JavaScript toolchain written in Rust.
- [php-rust-tools/parser](https://github.com/php-rust-tools/parser/): A PHP parser written in Rust, which influenced our parsing approach.
- [slackhq/hakana](https://github.com/slackhq/hakana/): A static analysis tool for HackLang written in Rust, by the creator of [Psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm).

These tools have inspired us and helped shape Mago's design and functionality.

### Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge the following PHP tools that have greatly helped hundreds of thousands of PHP developers in their journey,
ourselves included:

- [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer): A tool to automatically fix PHP Coding Standards issues.
- [Psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm): A static analysis tool for finding errors in PHP applications.
- [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan): PHP Static Analysis Tool.
- [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer): Detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.

While Mago is intended to be a comprehensive toolchain that may eventually replace some of these tools,
we deeply appreciate their contributions and the foundation they have built for the PHP community.
